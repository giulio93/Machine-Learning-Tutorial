INSTRUCTIONS
The following instructions are thought to be platform indipendent.

The Labs are essentially based on python3 and its "graphical frontend" Jupyter. 

Python has an internal packets/modules installer named pip so the required software is made by the following parts:

Packages:

python3
python3-pip
python3-pandas

Modules for pip: (generally, first of all, you should upgrade pip)
jupyter
h5py
scikit-image
keras (version 2.0.7)
tensorflow (version 1.2.1)
pydot



EXAMPLE

Linux users have an easy life (root shell or sudo commands):

apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-pandas
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter h5py scikit-image keras==2.0.7 tensorflow==1.2.1 pydot

Equivalent steps should be done with other operating system according to their internal organization (library managament, installers, etc).
